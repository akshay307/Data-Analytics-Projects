ACADEMIC RESEARCH PAPERS
1. Visual Analysis of Grocery Expenses to Interpret Dietary Habits - 
Data visualization helps identify relationships between dietary and behavioral factors among individuals. The study and analysis conducted can inform the audience about relationships between expenditure on different food items, their nutritional value, the cost savings and dietary trends. The study targets two important aspects: dietary patterns and monthly expenditure which can help create awareness in food consumption habits, facilitate healthy choices and track expenses. The analysis is based on data collected (educational purpose only) from two apartments each uniquely consisting of male and female members. The visualization report mainly focuses on three parts: (1) Individual Expense Trends (2) Expenditure Comparison (3) Annual Intake Trend.

2. Data Analysis of Airline On-time Performance - 
In the airline industry, it is very common that the airlines are finding it difficult to get plane to the gate on time. The major challenge the industry has been facing, is to improve the quality of the airline on-time performance. The goal of this research study is to determine which factor impacts most while determining the airline on-time performance, which airline industry the customer should choose and finally the time and day of the week at which a passenger must travel to avoid longer flight delays. The analysis is important because it will increase the Nationâ€™s understanding of airline transportation statistics and enable the people to better informed decisions about their travels. Additionally, this analysis can be used by the airline industries to work upon their performance by looking into the root causes of the various factors affecting it.

DATACAMP PROJECTS
1. Predicting Credit Card Approval - 
Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards and many of them get rejected for several reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming. Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning like most commercial banks do nowadays. In this project, I have built an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques learnt from DataCamp.

DATASET- Credit Card Approval dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
STEPS-
1 - Credit card applications
2 - Inspecting the applications
3 - Handling the missing values (part i)
4 - Handling the missing values (part ii)
5 - Handling the missing values (part iii)
6 - Preprocessing the data (part i)
7 - Splitting the dataset into train and test sets
8 - Preprocessing the data (part ii)
9 - Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set
10 - Making predictions and evaluating performance
11 - Grid searching and making the model perform better
12 - Finding the best performing model

2. The GitHub History of the Scala Language - 
Scala is an open source project With almost 30k commit history over ten years. Open source projects have the advantage that their entire development histories - who made changes, what was changed, code reviews, etc. are publicly available. In this project I have read in data, clean up, and visualize the real world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). The steps executed will help us find out who has had the most influence on Scala's development and who are the experts. 

DATASET- Previously mined and extracted from GitHub.
STEPS
1 - Scala's real-world project repository data
2 - Preparing and cleaning the data
3 - Merging the DataFrames
4 - Is the project still actively maintained?
5 - Is there camaraderie in the project?
6 - What files were changed in the last ten pull requests?
7 - Who made the most pull requests to a given file?
8 - Who made the last ten pull requests on a given file?
9 - The pull requests of two special developers
10 - Visualizing the contributions of each developer

3. The Android App Market on Google Play - 
In this notebook, I have performed a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. We'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention.

DATASET- open source Google play app data and reviews.
STEPS
1 - Google Play Store apps and reviews
2 - Data cleaning
3 - Exploring app categories
4 - Distribution of app ratings
5 - Size and price of an app
6 - Relation between app category and app price
7 - Filter out "junk" apps
8 - Popularity of paid apps vs free apps
9 - Sentiment analysis of user reviews
